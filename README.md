GAN-based Anime Face Synthesis with Optimization Techniques
This project demonstrates the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating anime-style faces. Leveraging deep learning, this model synthesizes high-quality anime character images by training on the Anime Face Dataset. To ensure efficient training and stable outputs, various optimization techniques, such as early stopping and dropout layers, were integrated into the GAN architecture.

Key Highlights:
GAN Architecture: Utilizes a robust Generator and Discriminator setup to produce realistic anime faces.
Optimized Training: Implemented strategies like early stopping to prevent overfitting and reduce computational cost.
Dataset: The Anime Face Dataset from Kaggle, consisting of over 60,000 images, was used to train the model.
Evaluation: Visual assessment was performed to ensure the quality and diversity of generated anime faces.
